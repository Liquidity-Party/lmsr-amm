# LMSR-based Multi-Asset AMM

## Abstract
We present a multi-asset automated market maker whose pricing kernel is the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) ([R. Hanson, 2002](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/mktscore.pdf)). The pool maintains the convex potential $C(\mathbf{q}) = b(\mathbf{q}) \log\!\Big(\sum_i e^{q_i / b(\mathbf{q})}\Big)$ over normalized inventories $\mathbf{q}$, and sets the effective liquidity parameter proportional to pool size as $b(\mathbf{q}) = \kappa \, S(\mathbf{q})$ with $S(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_i q_i$ and fixed $\kappa>0$. This proportional parameterization preserves scale-invariant responsiveness while retaining softmax-derived pairwise price ratios under a quasi-static-$b$ view, enabling any-to-any swaps within a single potential. We derive and use closed-form expressions for two-asset reductions to compute exact-in, exact-out, limit-hitting (swap-to-limit), and capped-output trades. We discuss stability techniques such as log-sum-exp, ratio-once shortcuts, and domain guards for fixed-point arithmetic. Liquidity operations (proportional and single-asset joins/exits) follow directly from the same potential and admit monotone, invertible mappings. Parameters are immutable post-deployment for transparency and predictable depth calibration.

## Introduction and Motivation
Multi-asset liquidity typically trades off simplicity and expressivity. Classical CFMMs define multiplicative invariants over reserves, while LMSR specifies a convex cost function whose gradient yields prices. Our goal is a multi-asset AMM that uses LMSR to support any-to-any swaps, shares risk across many assets, and scales depth predictably with pool size. By setting $b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa S(\mathbf{q})$, we achieve scale invariance: proportional rescaling of all balances scales $b$ proportionally and preserves pairwise price ratios, so the marketâ€™s responsiveness is consistent across liquidity regimes. The derivations below formulate instantaneous prices, closed-form swap mappings, limit logic, and liquidity operations tailored to this parameterization.

## System Model and Pricing Kernel
We consider $n\ge 2$ normalized assets with state vector $\mathbf{q}=(q_0,\dots,q_{n-1})\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{\,n}$ and size metric $S(\mathbf{q})=\sum_i q_i$. The kernel is the LMSR cost function
$$
C(\mathbf{q}) = b(\mathbf{q}) \log\!\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} e^{q_i / b(\mathbf{q})}\right), \qquad b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa\,S(\mathbf{q}),\quad \kappa>0.
$$
For numerical stability we evaluate $C$ with a log-sum-exp recentering. Let $y_i := q_i/b(\mathbf{q})$ and $M:=\max_i y_i$. Then
$$
C(\mathbf{q}) \;=\; b(\mathbf{q}) \left( M + \log \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} e^{\,y_i - M} \right),
$$
which prevents overflow/underflow when the $y_i$ are dispersed. Quantities are represented in fixed-point with explicit range and domain guards; equations are presented over the reals for clarity.

## Gradient, Price Shares, and Pairwise Prices
With $b$ treated as a constant parameter, the LMSR gradient recovers softmax shares
$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial q_i} \;=\; \frac{e^{q_i/b}}{\sum_k e^{q_k/b}} \;=:\; \pi_i(\mathbf{q}),
$$
so that the ratio of marginal prices is $\pi_j/\pi_i = \exp\!\big((q_j-q_i)/b\big)$. When $b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa S(\mathbf{q})$ depends on state, $\frac{\partial C}{\partial q_i}$ acquires a common additive term across $i$ from $\partial b/\partial q_i$, but pairwise ratios remain governed by softmax differences. We therefore use a quasi-static-$b$ view for pricing steps, holding $b$ fixed at the pre-trade state for the infinitesimal move, and define the instantaneous pairwise marginal price ratio for exchanging $i$ into $j$ as
$$
P(i\to j \mid \mathbf{q}) \;=\; \exp\!\left(\frac{q_j - q_i}{b(\mathbf{q})}\right).
$$
This ratio drives swap computations and is invariant to proportional rescaling $\mathbf{q}\mapsto \lambda\mathbf{q}$ because $b$ scales by the same factor.

## Two-Asset Reduction and Exact Swap Mappings
Swaps are computed in the two-asset subspace spanned by the in-asset $i$ and out-asset $j$, with all other coordinates held fixed under a quasi-static-$b$ step. Let
$$
r_0 \;:=\; \exp\!\left(\frac{q_i - q_j}{b}\right), \qquad b \equiv b(\mathbf{q})\;\text{ held quasi-static}.
$$
Along the $i\!\to\! j$ path, the instantaneous ratio evolves multiplicatively as $r(t)=r_0\,e^{t/b}$ where $t$ denotes cumulative input of asset $i$. In the two-asset reduction the infinitesimal output satisfies
$$
\mathrm{d}y \;=\; \frac{r(t)}{1+r(t)}\,\mathrm{d}t.
$$
Integrating from $t=0$ to $t=a$ yields the exact-in closed form
$$
y(a) \;=\; b \,\ln\!\Big( 1 + r_0 \,\big(1 - e^{-a/b}\big) \Big).
$$
This mapping has $y(0)=0$, is strictly increasing and concave in $a$, and satisfies $y'(0)=\frac{r_0}{1+r_0}$ with asymptote $\lim_{a\to\infty} y = b\,\ln(1+r_0)$. The inverse exact-out mapping follows by solving for $a$ in terms of target $y$. Writing $E:=e^{y/b}$, we obtain
$$
a(y) \;=\; b \,\ln\!\left(\frac{r_0}{\,r_0 + 1 - E\,}\right),
$$
which is strictly increasing and convex for $y\in\big[0,\, b\ln(1+r_0)\big]$. These two expressions are the workhorses for exact-in and exact-out swaps in our kernel.

## Price Limits, Swap-to-Limit, and Capacity Caps
Users may provide a maximum acceptable marginal price ratio $\Lambda>0$ for $p_i/p_j$. The marginal ratio trajectory $r(t)=r_0 e^{t/b}$ first reaches the limit at the unique
$$
a_{\text{lim}} \;=\; b \,\ln\!\left(\frac{\Lambda}{r_0}\right),
$$
and the output realized at that truncation is
$$
y_{\text{lim}} \;=\; b \,\ln\!\Big( 1 + r_0 \,\big(1 - r_0/\Lambda\big) \Big).
$$
Outputs are further bounded by available inventory; if a computed $y$ would exceed $q_j$, we cap at $y=q_j$ and compute the implied input by inverting the exact-out formula,
$$
a_{\text{cap}} \;=\; b \,\ln\!\left(\frac{r_0}{\,r_0 + 1 - e^{\,q_j/b}\,}\right).
$$
These limit and capacity branches ensure monotone, conservative behavior near domain edges.

## Liquidity Operations from the Same Potential
Liquidity is accounted via pool shares $L$ taken proportional to the size metric, and we set $L=S(\mathbf{q})$ without loss of generality. At initialization with seed balances $\mathbf{q}^{(0)}$ the pool sets $L^{(0)}=S^{(0)}$ and $b^{(0)}=\kappa S^{(0)}$. A proportional deposit that scales balances to $\mathbf{q}'=(1+\alpha)\mathbf{q}$ mints $\Delta L = \alpha S(\mathbf{q})$ shares and scales liquidity to $b'=(1+\alpha)b$. Single-asset deposits target a proportional growth while rebalancing through kernel swaps: providing amount $a$ of asset $i$ induces a growth factor $\alpha\ge 0$ satisfying the monotone equation
$$
a \;=\; a_{\text{req}}(\alpha) \;=\; \alpha q_i \;+\; \sum_{j\ne i} b \,\ln\!\left(\frac{r_{0,j}}{\,r_{0,j} + 1 - e^{\,\alpha q_j/b}\,}\right), \quad r_{0,j}:=\exp\!\left(\frac{q_i-q_j}{b}\right),
$$
and mints $\Delta L=\alpha S(\mathbf{q})$ upon the unique solution. Proportional withdrawals burn $\Delta L$ and return $\alpha=\Delta L/S(\mathbf{q})$ of each asset, updating $b$ to $(1-\alpha)b$. Single-asset withdrawals redeem $\alpha q_i$ directly and swap each redeemed $\alpha q_j$ for $j\ne i$ into $i$ using the exact-in mapping evaluated on the local post-burn state; any capacity overrun is handled by a cap-and-invert branch as above. Because all operations reduce to the same two-asset closed forms, they inherit monotonicity and uniqueness.

### Single-Asset Mint and Redeem

#### Single-Asset Mint
Given a deposit of amount $a>0$ of asset $i$, the pool targets a proportional growth factor $\alpha \ge 0$ so that the post-mint state can be rebalanced to $(1+\alpha)\,\mathbf{q}$ using fee-free kernel swaps from $i$ into each $j\ne i$. For each $j\ne i$, let $y_j := \alpha\,q_j$ and define $r_{0,j} := \exp\!\big((q_i - q_j)/b\big)$. The input required to realize $y_j$ via the exact-out inverse is
$$
x_j(\alpha) \;=\; b \,\ln\!\left(\frac{r_{0,j}}{\,r_{0,j} + 1 - e^{\,y_j/b}\,}\right),
$$
so the total required input for growth $\alpha$ is
$$
a_{\text{req}}(\alpha) \;=\; \alpha\,q_i \;+\; \sum_{j\ne i} x_j(\alpha).
$$
Properties and solver:
- Monotonicity: $a_{\text{req}}(\alpha)$ is strictly increasing on its feasible domain, guaranteeing a unique solution.
- Solver: bracket $\alpha$ (e.g., start from $\alpha\sim a/S$ and double until $a_{\text{req}}(\alpha)\ge a$ or a safety cap), then bisection to a small tolerance $\varepsilon$ (e.g., $\sim10^{-6}$ in fixed-point units).
- Guards: enforce $b>0$, $e^{y_j/b}$ within range, and positivity of the denominator $r_{0,j}+1-e^{y_j/b}$; if a guard would be violated for some $j$, treat that path as infeasible and adjust the bracket.
- Outcome: the consumed input is $a_{\text{in}} = a_{\text{req}}(\alpha^\star) \le a$ and minted LP shares are $\Delta L = \alpha^\star S(\mathbf{q})$.

#### Single-Asset Redeem
Burning a proportional share $\alpha \in (0,1]$ returns a single asset $i$ by redeeming and rebalancing from other assets into $i$:
1) Form the local state after burn, $\mathbf{q}_{\text{local}}=(1-\alpha)\,\mathbf{q}$.
2) Start with the direct redemption $\alpha\,q_i$ in asset $i$.
3) For each $j\ne i$, withdraw $a_j := \alpha\,q_j$ and swap $j\to i$ using the exact-in form evaluated at $\mathbf{q}_{\text{local}}$:
$$
r_{0,j} \;=\; \exp\!\left(\frac{q^{\text{local}}_j - q^{\text{local}}_i}{b}\right),\qquad
y_{j\to i} \;=\; b \,\ln\!\Big(1 + r_{0,j}\,\big(1 - e^{-a_j/b}\big)\Big).
$$
4) Capacity cap and inverse: if $y_{j\to i} > q^{\text{local}}_i$, cap to $y=q^{\text{local}}_i$ and solve the implied input via
$$
a_{j,\text{used}} \;=\; b \,\ln\!\left(\frac{r_{0,j}}{\,r_{0,j} + 1 - e^{\,q^{\text{local}}_i/b}\,}\right),
$$
then update $\mathbf{q}_{\text{local}}$ accordingly.
5) The single-asset payout is
$$
Y_i \;=\; \alpha\,q_i \;+\; \sum_{j\ne i} y_{j\to i}, \qquad \text{with LP burned } L_{\text{in}} = \alpha \, S(\mathbf{q}).
$$
Guards and behavior:
- Enforce $b>0$, positivity of inner terms (e.g., $r_{0,j} + 1 - e^{y/b} > 0$), and safe exponent ranges; treat any per-asset numerical failure as zero contribution rather than aborting the whole redeem.
- The mapping is monotone in $\alpha$; the cap-and-invert branch preserves safety near capacity.

### LP Pricing vs. an Asset Token
With LP supply set to $L=S(\mathbf{q})$, the instantaneous price of one LP share in units of asset $k$ aggregates marginal exchange rates from each asset into $k$:
$$
P_L^{(k)}(\mathbf{q}) \;=\; \frac{1}{S(\mathbf{q})}\,\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} q_j \,\exp\!\left(\frac{q_j - q_k}{b(\mathbf{q})}\right).
$$
Interpretation: proportional deposits leave $P_L^{(k)}$ unchanged; swap fees retained in the pool increase $S$ relative to outstanding $L$, raising $P_L^{(k)}$ (implicit fee accrual). This expression helps LPs and integrators reason about share valuation and dilution across assets.

## Numerical Methods and Safety Guarantees
We evaluate log-sum-exp with recentring, compute ratios like $r_0=\exp((q_i-q_j)/b)$ directly rather than dividing exponentials, and guard all $\exp$ and $\ln$ calls to bounded domains with explicit checks on positivity of inner terms such as $r_0+1-e^{y/b}$. Fixed-point implementations precompute reciprocals like $1/b$ to reduce dispersion, clamp to capacity before inversion, and select cap-and-invert rather than extrapolating when inner terms approach zero. These measures ensure the swap maps remain strictly order-preserving and free of nonphysical outputs. Property-based and differential testing can confirm monotonicity of $y(a)$ and $a(y)$, uniqueness of limit hits when $\Lambda>r_0$, and adherence to predefined error budgets.

## Balanced Regime Optimization: Approximations, Dispatcher, and Stability
Since transcendental operations are gas-expensive on EVM chains, we use polynomial approximations in near-balanced regimes (e.g., stable-asset pairs) while preserving monotonicity and domain safety. Parameterize $\delta := (q_i - q_j)/b$ and $\tau := a/b$ for an $i\!\to\! j$ exact-in step. The exact mapping
$$
y(a) \;=\; b \,\ln\!\Big(1 + e^{\delta}\,\big(1 - e^{-\tau}\big)\Big)
$$
admits small-argument expansions for $|\delta|\ll 1$ and $|\tau|\ll 1$. Using $e^{\pm x}\approx 1\pm x+\tfrac{x^2}{2}$ and $\ln(1+u)\approx u - \tfrac{u^2}{2}$, we obtain
$$
y(a) \;\approx\; b \left[ r_0 \tau - \tfrac{1}{2} r_0 \tau^2 \right] + \mathcal{O}\!\left(\tau^3,\, |\delta|\,\tau^2\right), \qquad r_0=e^{\delta}\approx 1+\delta+\tfrac{\delta^2}{2},
$$
and at $\delta=0$ the symmetry reduces to $y(a)\approx \tfrac{a}{2} - \tfrac{a^2}{4b} + \cdots$.

### Dispatcher preconditions and thresholds (approx path):
- Scope: two-asset pools only; otherwise use the exact path.
- Magnitude bounds: $|\delta| \le 0.01$ and $\tau := a/b$ satisfies $0 < \tau \le 0.5$.
- Tiering: use the quadratic surrogate for $\tau \le 0.1$, and include a cubic correction for $0.1 < \tau \le 0.5$.
- Limit-price gate: approximate the limit truncation only when a positive limit is provided with $\Lambda>r_0$ and $|(\Lambda/r_0)-1| \le 0.1$; otherwise compute the limit exactly (or reject if $\Lambda \le r_0$).
- Capacity and positivity: require $b>0$ and $a>0$, and ensure the approximated output $\tilde{y}(a) \le q_j$; otherwise fall back to the exact cap-and-invert.
- Example thresholds: $\delta_\star=0.01$, $\tau_{\text{tier1}}=0.1$, $\tau_\star=0.5$, and an auxiliary limit-ratio gate $|x| \le 0.1$ where $x=(\Lambda/r_0)-1$ (for reference, $e^{\delta_\star}\approx 1.01005$).

### Approximation Path
- Replace $\exp$ on the bounded $\tau$ domain and $\ln(1+\cdot)$ with verified polynomials to meet a global error budget while maintaining $\tilde{y}'(a)>0$ on the domain.
- Cache common subexpressions (e.g., $r_0=e^\delta$, $\tau=a/b$) and guard inner terms to remain in $(0,\infty)$.

### Fallback Policy
- If any precondition fails (magnitude, domain, capacity, or limit binding), evaluate the exact closed forms for $y(a)$ or $a(y)$ (with cap and limit branches), preserving monotonicity and uniqueness.
- Prefer cap-and-invert near capacity or when the inner term of $\ln(\cdot)$ approaches zero.

### Error Shape
- The small-argument expansion above shows the leading behavior; when using polynomial surrogates, the composed relative error can be kept within a target $\epsilon$ with degrees chosen for the specified $(\delta_\star,\tau_\star,u_\star)$, yielding an error budget of the form $\epsilon \approx \epsilon_{\exp} + \epsilon_{\ln} + c_1 \tau_\star + c_2 |\delta_\star| \tau_\star$ for modest constants $c_1,c_2$.
- These bounds ensure the approximated path remains order-preserving and safely within domain; outside the domain, the dispatcher reverts to the exact path.
- Regardless of path, our policy prioritizes monotonicity, domain safety, and conservative decisions at boundaries.

## Fees and Economic Considerations
Swap fees are applied outside the fee-free kernel. For an exact-in submission $a$ on asset $i$, the effective kernel input is $a_{\text{eff}}=(1-f_{\text{swap}})a$. The kernel computes output using $a_{\text{eff}}$, while the retained fee remains in the pool, increasing $S(\mathbf{q})$ relative to outstanding $L$ and thereby accruing value to LPs implicitly. Scale invariance under $b=\kappa S$ implies that proportional growth of inventories preserves price ratios while deepening notional liquidity linearly. The classical LMSR bounded-loss intuition for constant $b$ gives $b\ln n$ in appropriate units; under our proportional $b$, this scales with $S$, so the instantaneous bound per unit of $S$ is proportional to $\kappa\ln n$.

## Risk Management and Bounded Loss
Under constant $b$, classical LMSR admits a worst-case loss bound of $b \ln n$ in the payoff numÃ©raire. With $b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa S(\mathbf{q})$, the per-state bound scales with the current size metric, giving an instantaneous worst-case loss $b(\mathbf{q}) \ln n = \kappa\,S(\mathbf{q})\,\ln n$; per unit of size $S$ this is $\kappa \ln n$. Because $b$ varies with state, global worst-case loss along an arbitrary path depends on how $S$ evolves, but the proportionality clarifies how risk scales with liquidity. Operational mitigations include user price limits (swap-to-limit), capacity caps on outputs ($y \le q_j$), minimum bootstrap $S^{(0)}$ to avoid thin-liquidity regimes, and strict numerical guards (e.g., positivity of inner logarithm arguments) to prevent nonphysical states.

## Deployment and Parameter Fixity
The parameter tuple $(\kappa, f_{\text{swap}}, \phi)$ is set at deployment and remains immutable, with $\kappa>0$ defining $b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa S(\mathbf{q})$, $f_{\text{swap}}$ the swap fee rate, and $\phi$ the protocol share of fees. Given the initial state $\mathbf{q}^{(0)}$ with $S^{(0)}>0$, the induced pricing map is fully determined by
$$
C(\mathbf{q}) = b(\mathbf{q}) \log\!\left(\sum_i e^{q_i / b(\mathbf{q})}\right), \qquad b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa S(\mathbf{q}),
$$
and the two-asset closed forms above. Fixity eliminates governance risk, makes depth calibration transparent, and simplifies integration for external routers and valuation tools.

## Conclusion
By coupling LMSR with the proportional parameterization $b(\mathbf{q})=\kappa S(\mathbf{q})$, we obtain a multi-asset AMM that preserves softmax-driven price ratios under a quasi-static-$b$ view and supports any-to-any swaps via a single convex potential. Exact two-asset reductions yield closed-form mappings for exact-in, exact-out, limit-hitting, and capped-output trades, and the same formulas underpin liquidity operations with monotonicity and uniqueness. Numerical stability follows from log-sum-exp evaluation, ratio-first derivations, guarded transcendental domains, and optional near-balance approximations, while fixed parameters provide predictable scaling and transparent economics.
